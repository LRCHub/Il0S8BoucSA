[00:12.29] I took an arrow to the heart
[00:15.50] I never kissed a mouth that taste like yours
[00:18.60] Strawberries and something more
[00:22.26] Ooh, yeah, I want it all
[00:34.26] 
[00:26.55] Lipstick on my guitar (ooh)
[00:28.99] Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
[00:31.10] Go dancing underneath the stars
[00:35.53] Ooh, yeah, I want it all
[00:39.50] Hmm, you got me feeling like
[00:53.50] 
[00:40.57] I wanna be that guy
[00:43.10] I wanna kiss your eyes
[00:44.98] I wanna drink that smile
[00:46.70] I wanna feel like I'm
[00:48.24] Like my soul's on fire
[00:49.90] I wanna stay up all day and all night
[00:52.51] Yeah, you got me singing like
[01:07.01] 
[00:54.69] Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
[00:57.61] And when you're close up, give me the shivers
[01:00.32] Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
[01:04.31] And when they say the party's over, then we bring it right back
[01:35.81] 
[01:05.64] And we'll say
[01:07.66] Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
[01:10.71] And when you're close up, give me the shivers
[01:13.32] Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks?
[01:17.62] And when they say the party's over, then we bring it right back
[01:49.12] 
[01:21.75] Into the car
[01:23.63] On the back seat in the moonlit dark
[01:27.06] Wrap me up between your legs and arms
[01:30.00] Ooh, I can't get enough
[01:41.50] 
[01:33.40] You know you could tear me apart (ooh)
[01:37.06] Put me back together, and take my heart
[01:40.49] I never thought that I could love this hard
[01:43.79] Ooh, I can't get enough
[01:47.36] Hmm, you got me feeling like
[02:01.36]
